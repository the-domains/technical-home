Home Inspection: What, Why, Who - Because!

Home | Yours and Ours
  

Good Day and Greetings from Technical Home Inspection Services | M4Group! 

We as homeowners have the same concerns and care for our home as you do.â€¨Safety, Security, Function and Comfort right? -- of course. 

Live assured that when you make the great choice to request our services, you have commissioned The Inspection Company with heart, attention to detail, balanced \[joyful and energetic\] thought, inviting and friendly presence, with an objective, thorough, non-alarmist form of education and informative inspection. 

We have been in business since 2004, have inspected thousands of properties, primarily residential-but also commercial and governmental buildings. 

We were the first Certified Home Inspection Service in the Graham and Greenlee County Area following the Arizona State Law of 2002: "Requiring all home inspectors be licensed, bonded or insured, have accredited education recognized and approved by the State of Arizona Board of Technical Registration, proper background checks and complete a regimen of field work, monitored tests and a minimum of 30 inspections with an already licensed Arizona Inspector." 

Having said this -- we were happy to fulfill these requirements at or above the standards and bring the Licensed Inspection Industry to our home / your home.
We pioneered the Licensed Trade in Graham, Greenlee and Neighboring Counties where the New Standards and Governable Rules were not-yet introduced.
